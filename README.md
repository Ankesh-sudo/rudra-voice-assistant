# Rudra – Hybrid Offline Voice Assistant

Rudra is an **offline-first, hybrid voice assistant** designed to be fast,
privacy-respecting, and fully controllable across devices (Linux, Windows,
Android, Raspberry Pi).

Unlike cloud-locked assistants, Rudra performs **core intelligence locally**
and uses the cloud only as an enhancement layer.
